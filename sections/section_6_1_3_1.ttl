    firebim:hasOriginalText """6.1.3.1 A smoke detection system will be placed at the top of the shaft. In case of detection of smoke in 
the shaft, the cabin will stop in accordance with 6.1.1.7. The detection system in the shaft shall be 
provided so that its maintenance and control can be done from outside the shaft.
The elevator will only be able to be reactivated by an authorized person.
6.1.3.2 The shaft should be naturally ventilated through outside air nozzles.
The ventilation opening, located at the top of the shaft, has a minimum cross-sectional area of 4% 
of the horizontal area of the shaft.
6.1.4 Oleohydraulic elevators
The machine room is separated from the elevator shaft. The walls of the machine room have Rf 1 
h.
Access to the engine room is through a self-closing door Rf ½ h.
The machine rooms and elevator shafts should be naturally ventilated through outside air nozzles.
The ventilation openings have a minimum cross-sectional area of 4% of the horizontal cross-
sectional area of the room.
The level of the engine room door thresholds is raised so that the tub thus formed has a capacity 
at least equal to 1.2 times the oil content of the machinery.
Electrical equipment as well as electrical and hydraulic lines running from the engine room to the 
elevator shaft are installed higher than the highest level that the drained oil in the engine room can 
reach. The space around the penetrations for these pipes, should be sealed with materials with at 
least the same Rf as the wall.""" ;
