In this case, an audible alarm signal should alert those in the cabin to exit the elevator when it stops; the doors open and remain open just long enough for passengers to exit, that is, at least 15 seconds. The mechanisms enabling the opening of the doors remain active. This operation must take precedence over any other command." .
