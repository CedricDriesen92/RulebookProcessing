This rule specifies conditions for compartment area and length, with exceptions for parkings, specific building types, and equipped compartments.
The last sentence regarding ministerial exceptions ('De Minister van Binnenlandse Zaken bepaalt de voorwaarden...') is a provision for future/external conditions and is not fully modeled here as those specific conditions are not part of this text. If such conditions were defined and representable in data (e.g., via a property like fbo:hasApprovedMinisterialException), an additional 'or' branch could be added."""@en ;
