It primarily addresses:
1. Location of exits in opposite zones of a compartment. (S1)
2. Permissible destinations for evacuation routes originating from the compartment. (S2)

Contextual clauses from the article are noted here:
- S3 (Underground): An alternative exit to the outside (via route with EI 30 walls, EI1 30 doors) may replace a stairwell access. This implies conditions on such a route if used.
- S4 (Parking): Excluded from this shape's target as it refers to section 5.2. (Handled by sh:target)
- S5 (Stairs on Evacuation Level): General rule for such stairs to lead outside, either directly or via an evacuation route compliant with 4.4.
These contextual clauses may require separate, more specific shapes or conditional logic beyond this primary shape's scope if fully formalized as direct constraints on the compartment.
