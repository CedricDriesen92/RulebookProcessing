This is assessed by exposing the door wall on the side of the \nplatform to the fire.\nThe platform wall will be tested with any operating and control devices that are part of it.\n6.1.1.5 When the elevator calls on only one compartment, the walls of the shaft, referred to in 6.1.1.3, and \nthe shaft doors, referred to in 6.1.1.4, shall not meet the respective requirements for fire \nresistance, stability in the event of fire, and flame tightness.\nYet the walls of an elevator shaft in a stairwell are solid, continuous and non-combustible.\n6.1.1.6 No extinguishing device containing water shall be installed in the shaft(s).\n6.1.1.7 In case of abnormal increase in the temperature of the machine and/or of the control organs, the \nelevators must be designed and constructed to stop at the first access platform that is technically \npossible, but refuse new operating orders.\nIn this case, an audible alarm signal should alert those in the cabin to exit the elevator when it \nstops; the doors open and remain open just long enough for passengers to exit, that is, at least 15 \nseconds.\nThe mechanisms enabling the opening of the doors remain active. This operation \nmust take precedence over any other command.\n6.1.1.8 If the building is equipped with a fire detection - system, the elevators should be recalled to the \nevacuation level if a fire is detected outside the elevators and their associated components.\nThe shaft doors open, and remain open just long enough for passengers to exit, that is, at least 15 \nseconds, after which the elevator becomes inoperative.\nThe mechanisms that allow the doors to open remain active.\nFederal Public Service Home Affairs\nGeneral Directorate of Civil Security - Fire Prevention.\nANNEX 2: LOW BUILDINGS36/281\n(v3.0)\nRoyal Decree of July 7, 1994 (coordinated version on May 20, 2022).The elevator will only be able to be reactivated by an authorized person.\n6.1.2 Elevators and freight elevators whose machinery is located in a machine room.\n6.1.2.1 The walls enclosing the assembly formed by the shaft and engine room have Rf 1 h.\nIf the engine room door or trap door gives out into the building, they have Rf \u00bd h.

 "FullText": "6.1.3.1 A smoke detection system will be placed at the top of the shaft. In case of detection of smoke in \nthe shaft, the cabin will stop in accordance with 6.1.1.7. The detection system in the shaft shall be \nprovided so that its maintenance and control can be done from outside the shaft.\nThe elevator will only be able to be reactivated by an authorized person.\n6.1.3.2 The shaft should be naturally ventilated through outside air nozzles.\nThe ventilation opening, located at the top of the shaft, has a minimum cross-sectional area of 4% \nof the horizontal area of the shaft.\n6.1.4 Oleohydraulic elevators\nThe machine room is separated from the elevator shaft. The walls of the machine room have Rf 1 \nh.\nAccess to the engine room is through a self-closing door Rf \u00bd h.\nThe machine rooms and elevator shafts should be naturally ventilated through outside air nozzles.\nThe ventilation openings have a minimum cross-sectional area of 4% of the horizontal cross-\nsectional area of the room.\nThe level of the engine room door thresholds is raised so that the tub thus formed has a capacity \nat least equal to 1.2 times the oil content of the machinery.\nElectrical equipment as well as electrical and hydraulic lines running from the engine room to the \nelevator shaft are installed higher than the highest level that the drained oil in the engine room can \nreach. The space around the penetrations for these pipes, should be sealed with materials with at \nleast the same Rf as the wall."
